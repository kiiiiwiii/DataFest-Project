# Assuming 'data' is your dataset
data_long <- data %>%

  pivot_wider(names_from = construct, values_from = response)

# Now 'data' should have one row per 'EOC' and one column for each 'construct' category,
# with the values being the mean 'response' for that combination.

model = lm(EOC ~ ., data_long)
summary(model)
